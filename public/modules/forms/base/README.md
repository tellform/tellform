Tellform Angular Form UI Module

##About
This module gives you the standalone front-end of tellform. It handles form rendering and form ui. For you to use this module you must have an API endpoint, such as (Formkeep)[https://formkeep.com].

This is a readonly split of the tellform project.

To see it in action clone this repos, run `npm install` and open the file `demo/index.html`.

##Disclaimer
This is a largely work in progress, use it at your own risk.
