## How to Contribute

~~Please checkout our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on ways to contribute to TellForm.~~

For now until we establish contribution guidelines I recommend just forking, branching and submitting a PR for your feature.  The more information you can submit with your PR the better.  If it includes test results proving that there are no regressions and there are no merge conflicts that can't be easily resolved it can be merged straight away!

For the moment contributor stickers will be on hold until the project is more actively maintained.  Feel free to volunteer via [CodeShelter][CodeShelter] *OR* via this [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tellform/tellform/issues/331)

~~All contributors are eligible to get a free [TellForm Sticker](https://www.stickermule.com/marketplace/15987-tellform-round-sticker). All you have to do is submit a PR, get it accepted, email your address to `team [at] tellform [dot] com` and we'll send you a sticker that you can proudly put on your laptop.~~

## Quickstart

Before you start, make sure you have
  1. [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed and running at `127.0.0.1:6379`
  2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running at `127.0.0.1:27017` (OR specify the host and port in config/env/all)

Also make sure to install [DNS Masq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) or equivalent if running it locally on your computer (look at dns_masq_setup_osx for instructions on OSX)

Install dependencies first.

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Setup environment.

```bash
$ grunt build
```

Create your user account

```bash
$ node ./scripts/setup.js
```

**OR** create your `.env` file

```bash
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=yourGAID
PRERENDER_TOKEN=yourPrerender.ioToken
COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=yourCoveralls.ioToken
BASE_URL=localhost
DSN_KEY=yourPrivateRavenKey

# Mail config
MAILER_EMAIL_ID=user@domain.com
MAILER_PASSWORD=some-pass
MAILER_FROM=user@domain.com

# Use this for one of Nodemailer's pre-configured service providers
MAILER_SERVICE_PROVIDER=SendGrid

# Use these for a custom service provider
# Note: MAILER_SMTP_HOST will override MAILER_SERVICE_PROVIDER
MAILER_SMTP_HOST=smtp.domain.com
MAILER_SMTP_PORT=465
MAILER_SMTP_SECURE=TRUE
```

**Side note:** *Currently we are using Raven and Sentry [https://www.getsentry.com](https://www.getsentry.com) for error logging. To use it you must provide a valid private DSN key in your .env file and a public DSN key in app/views/layout.index.html*

#### To run the development version:

Set `NODE_ENV=development` in your .env file
`$ grunt`

#### To run the production version:

Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your .env file
`$ grunt`

Your application should run on port `3000` or the port you specified in your .env file, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deploying with Docker

To deploy with docker, first install docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

Then run follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the repo

`$ git clone https://github.com/tellform/docker_files.git`

### Step 2: Setup TellForm Configuration

Create your .env file by copying the `.env.dist` file included in the repo and changing it to suit your deployment.

Important: You need to fill out all of the ENV variables in the "Mail Settings" section or your TellForm instance won't work.

If you want to have https, make sure to change `TLS_FLAVOR` with one of the options from the [configuration][#Configuration] table below.

### Step 3: Start your TellForm instance

`docker-compose up -d`

TellForm should now be accessible on `http://localhost`

## Testing Your Application

You can run the full test suite included with TellForm with the test task:

```bash
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests `(located in the app/tests/ directory)` and the client-side tests `(located in the public/modules/*/tests/).`

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ grunt test:client
```

Currently the live example uses heroku github deployments. The Docker file is out of date and does not work. If someone wishes to get it working feel free to submit a pull request.

To calculate your total test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task

```bash
$ grunt coverage
```

To calculate your server-side test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task

```bash
$ grunt coverage:server
```

To calculate your client-side test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task

```bash
$ grunt coverage:client
```

## Configuration

TellForm's configuration is done with environment variables. To set an option for TellForm, open/create your .env file and set add `ENV_VAR=somevalue` to set the ENV_VAR variable to the value `somevalue`.
